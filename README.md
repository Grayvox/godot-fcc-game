# Cherry Hunter - The Game

I created this game for a freeCodeCamp course on Godot Engine. The "loose title" of the game is Cherry Hunter - the point being to collect all 8 cherries in order to win. 
I may eventually put the game on Itch.io but I've yet to decide this as of right now.

Game written entirely in GDScript
